<h1> Privacy Policy </h1>


This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our application ("App"). By using the App, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

1. Information We Collect
We do not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information (PII) from users. The App interacts with the Facebook Graph API to access publicly available data only, such as:

<li>Posts and comments from public Facebook Pages or Groups (as permitted by API)</li>

<li>Engagement metrics (likes, reactions, shares)</li>

<li>Public metadata (timestamps, IDs)</li>

We do not access:

<li>User profiles</li>

<li>Friend lists</li>

<li>Email addresses</li>

<li>Phone numbers</li>

<li>Private messages or content</li>

2. Use of Facebook Data
Our App uses Facebook Graph API strictly to retrieve publicly accessible content from Facebook Pages or Groups for analytical, academic, or research purposes. This access complies with Facebook's Platform Terms and applicable data use policies.

We do not use the data for:

<li>Commercial resale</li>

<li>Targeted advertising</li>

<li>User profiling</li>

<li>We do not request or store any access tokens beyond the current session.

3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not share or sell any data retrieved via the App with third parties. All data remains local to the user session and is used exclusively for non-commercial purposes.

<li>We may disclose minimal information if legally required to comply with applicable laws or valid legal processes (e.g., court orders).

4. Data Storage
The App does not store any user data on external servers. All data processing happens locally on the userâ€™s device. The App does not have a backend or cloud component.

5. Security
Although we do not store sensitive data, we recommend that users use personal access tokens securely and never share them with others. Any access token used should be revoked via Facebook's settings if there is suspicion of misuse.

6. Children's Privacy
Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any data from individuals under 13 years of age.

7. Third-Party Links
The App may include links to external websites or documentation. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such third-party sites.
